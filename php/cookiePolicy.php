      <h1>Cookie Use Policy</h1>
      <h2>ListManager</h2>

      <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
      <p>Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on 
        your computer or mobile device that uniquely identify your browser or device. What are 
        cookies used for?</p>
      <p>Cookies allow a site or services to know if your computer or device has visited that 
        site or service before. Cookies can then be used to help understand how the site or 
        service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help remember your 
        preferences, and generally improve your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure 
        marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

      <h4>What types of cookies does AppSolution use?</h4>
      <p>There are generally four categories of cookies: “Strictly Necessary,” “Performance,” 
        “Functionality,” and “Targeting.” AppSolution routinely uses all four categories of cookies 
        on the Service. You can find out more about each cookie category below.</p>
        
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Strictly Necessary Cookies.</strong>These cookies are essential, as they 
        enable you to move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing logged in 
        or secure areas.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Performance Cookies.</strong>These cookies collect information about how you have used 
          the Service, for example, information related to the unique username you have provided, 
          so that less strain is placed on our backend infrastructure. These cookies may also be 
          used to allow us to know that you have logged in so that we can serve you fresher content 
          than a user who has never logged in. We also use cookies to track aggregate Service usage 
          and experiment with new features and changes on the Service. The information collected is 
          used to improve how the Service works.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Functionality Cookies.</strong>These cookies allow us to remember how you’re logged in, 
        whether you chose to no longer see advertisements, whether you made an edit to an article on the 
        Service while logged out, when you logged in or out, the state or history of Service tools you’ve 
        used. These cookies also allow us to tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content 
        for you and to remember how you’ve customized the Service in other ways. The information these cookies 
        collect may be anonymous, and they are not used to track your browsing activity on other sites or 
        services.</li>
        <!-- <li><strong>4. Targeting Cookies.</strong>AppSolution, our advertising partners or other third party 
        partners may use these types of cookies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests. 
        These cookies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to 
        track your device’s browsing activity on other sites or services other than AppSolution. This information 
        may be shared with organizations outside AppSolution, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to 
        deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign, or other 
        business partners for the purpose of providing aggregate Service usage statistics and aggregate 
        Service testing..</li> -->
      </ul>
 
      <h4>How long will cookies stay on my device?</h4> 
      <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a 
        “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. 
        Persistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.</p>

      <h4>First and third party cookies</h4>
      <p>First-party cookies are cookies that belong to AppSolution, third-party cookies are cookies that another 
        party places on your device through our Service. Third-party cookies may be placed on your device by someone 
        providing a service for AppSolution, for example to help us understand how our service is being used. Third-party 
        cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use them to advertise 
        products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.</p>
      
      <h4>How to control and delete cookies</h4>
      <p>You can find out more information cookie settings at third-party information sites, such as www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

      <h4>Contact Us</h4>
      <p>Should you have any further questions, concerns, or queries about the Cookie Policy, or if you 
      encounter difficulties while navigating and using the site, please contact office@appsolution.online.</p>
